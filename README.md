# 🌍 WHO Malaria Cases and Deaths (2000–2014)

This analysis explores the global burden of malaria from **2000 to 2014**, focusing on the number of recorded **malaria cases and deaths** across six major WHO regions:

- **Africa**
- **Americas**
- **Europe**
- **Eastern Mediterranean**
- **South-East Asia**
- **Western Pacific**

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

The goal is to understand malaria trends globally over time, identify regions with the highest impact, and assess how the burden of the disease has shifted.

---

## ✅ Work Done

- 🔹 Data Cleaning  
- 🔹 Data Modeling  
- 🔹 Pivot Table Analysis  
- 🔹 Data Visualization (charts, graphs, trend lines)

---

## 📊 Data Source

The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle** and includes malaria case and death records from **2000 to 2014**.

> **Note:** This analysis is based on data up to **2014** and doesn't reflect recent updates or interventions post-2014.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

### 💉 Malaria Cases

- **Africa** had the **highest** recorded malaria cases: **267,697,234**
- **Europe** had the **lowest**: **116,175**

### 📉 Trend in Cases

There was a **steady increase in malaria cases** globally from **2000 to 2014**.

---

### ☠️ Malaria Deaths

- **Africa** again had the **highest number of deaths**: **1,741,817**
- **Europe** had the **lowest**: **46**

### 📉 Trend in Deaths

- Deaths **rose steadily** from **2000 to 2004**
- **Declined** from **2004 to 2008**
- **Rose again** until **2010**
- Then showed a **consistent decline** from **2010 to 2014**

---

## 🧠 Conclusion

Despite ongoing interventions, **malaria remains a global health challenge**. The African region is hit the hardest, and while deaths have started to decline after 2010, the case count continues to climb.

### ⚠️ What Needs to Happen?

- Scale up **existing interventions** like:
  - Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)
  - Antimalarial drugs
  - Indoor residual spraying (IRS)
  - The **malaria vaccine**
- Push for more **research and innovation** to find new, sustainable solutions
